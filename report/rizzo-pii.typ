  Millions of people now paste e-mails, contracts, court filings and other
  sensitive documents into closed frontier assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude
  and Gemini. That text leaves the user's machine and travels to third-party
  servers, where it may be logged, cached, processed or retained, a poor fit
  for legal practice, healthcare or anyone bound by the GDPR. Running a
  comparable model locally is the obvious cure, but a frontier-grade open model
  needs a workstation that most individuals and small firms cannot afford, while
  the small models that *do* fit a laptop are not competitive on demanding
  Italian legal text. We propose a different trade-off: keep using the best
  closed models, but never send them raw data. *rizzo-pii:0.3B* is a
  token-classification model (≈0.3B parameters, ModernBERT/mmBERT backbone) that
  runs on a *CPU* in roughly *0.5 GB of RAM*, detects 22 categories of personal
  data (including Italian-specific identifiers such as *codice fiscale*,
  *partita IVA* and *dati catastali* that no other open model covers) and
  drives a fully *reversible* anonymization workflow: redact locally, query the
  frontier model with placeholders, then reconstruct the real values from a
  local dictionary. On a held-out, real-text Italian benchmark the model reaches
  *0.989 micro-F1* (0.987 precision, 0.990 recall). We describe the model, the
  ~745k-row multilingual training corpus, the "LLM-author / code-labeler"
  synthetic-data method, the results, and an open call to build a large,
  community-owned Italian PII dataset.
]

// =============================================================================
= The problem: convenience is leaking your data
// =============================================================================

Large closed assistants have become everyday tools. People summarize contracts,
draft replies to e-mails, translate medical reports and ask legal questions by
simply *pasting the document in*. It is fast, it is useful, and it quietly
moves enormous amounts of personal and confidential data off the user's device.
Names, addresses, tax codes, IBANs, health details, clauses of unsigned
contracts: all of it crosses the network to servers the user does not control,
where it may be retained, used for analytics, or exposed in a breach. For a law
firm, an accountant or a hospital, this is not a hypothetical risk; under the
GDPR it can be a direct compliance failure, because the data subject's
information is transferred to third parties without a sound legal basis or
adequate safeguards.

The intuitive fix is to *stop sending data out* and run an open model locally.
The difficulty is cost. A frontier-grade open model is large: serving a
state-of-the-art mixture-of-experts model (a DeepSeek-class model, for instance,
in setups reportedly built on ~128 GB of unified memory such as Salvatore
Sanfilippo's _DwarfStar_) lands around *€9,000–€10,000* of hardware, out of
reach for most professionals and individuals. The models that comfortably fit a
normal machine (the small open models in the 2B–12B class, e.g. the Gemma
family) are genuinely useful, but they are *not* in the same league as ChatGPT,
Claude or Gemini precisely on the hard tasks: legal reasoning, statutes, dense
contracts and long official documents, which is exactly where Italian
professionals need the most help.

#callout("The trade-off we actually want")[
  We do not have to choose between *capability* (frontier closed models) and
  *privacy* (small local models). We can keep the frontier model and remove the
  data from the equation: anonymize the document *locally* on a CPU, send only
  placeholders to the cloud, and restore the real values *locally* from the
  answer. The sensitive content never leaves the machine.

    The workflow has three local steps and one remote step. Locally, rizzo-pii
    tags every span of personal data and replaces each one with a stable,
    type-aware placeholder (`[FULLNAME_1]`, `[IBAN_1]`, `[CF_1]`), recording the
    mapping `placeholder → real value` in a dictionary that *stays on disk*.
    Identical values share the same placeholder, so the frontier model still sees
    a coherent text and can reason about it. The anonymized text (and only the
    anonymized text) is sent to ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini. When the answer comes
    back, a local pass swaps the placeholders for the true values using the
    dictionary. The cloud provider never receives a single real name, code or
    number.

)

// =============================================================================
= Why this is different: privacy that is actually private
// =============================================================================

The point of rizzo-pii is not "yet another PII detector". It is an
*architecture for using powerful models without surrendering data*, and it is
built so that the privacy guarantee is structural rather than a promise:

- *The data never leaves the device.* Detection and re-identification run
  locally on a CPU. There is no API key, no telemetry, no upload. What the cloud
  receives is already stripped of identifiers.
- *GDPR by design.* The workflow implements *data minimization* (Art. 5) almost
  literally: the third-party processor only ever sees pseudonymized text, so the
  most common reason a cloud LLM call is unlawful (transferring identifiable
  personal data to a third party / third country without basis) is removed at
  the source.
- *Aligned with the EU AI Act.* Keeping personal data under local control and
  out of third-party model pipelines supports the Act's emphasis on data
  governance and on protecting individuals' rights when AI systems are used.
- *Accessible to everyone.* Because the model is ~0.3B parameters and runs on a
  CPU in well under 1 GB of RAM, the privacy layer costs nothing extra in
  hardware. You do not need a €10k workstation to keep your clients' data
  private: a normal laptop is enough.
- *Reversible, not destructive.* Classic redaction throws information away.
  rizzo-pii *pseudonymizes*: the answer you get from the frontier model is
  reconstructed with the real values, so the tool is useful in real work, not
  just for compliance theater.

// =============================================================================

PII detection is an established task, but the existing open tools are a poor fit
for the Italian legal use case.

*Microsoft Presidio* is the de-facto open framework: a pipeline of spaCy NER
plus regular-expression recognizers and checksum validators. It is flexible and
extensible, but out of the box it is English-centric and carries no native
notion of Italian legal identifiers; getting good Italian-legal coverage means
building and maintaining custom recognizers yourself.

*OpenAI Privacy Filter* (released 2026, Apache-2.0) is the closest analogue in
spirit: an on-device, token-classification model for high-throughput data
sanitization. It is a strong, modern system: a 1.5B-parameter sparse
mixture-of-experts (≈50M active, 128 experts, top-4), 128k-token context,
BIOES spans decoded with a constrained Viterbi pass. But it is built for a
different audience. It detects *eight* generic categories
(`private_person`, `private_address`, `private_email`, `private_phone`,
`private_url`, `account_number`, `private_date`, `secret`), it is *primarily
English*, and it has *no concept* of the identifiers that dominate Italian legal
documents: there is no `codice fiscale`, no `partita IVA`, no `dati catastali`,
no protocol/repertory document numbers, no vehicle plate. And despite being
"small" in active compute, it still needs *1.5B parameters resident in memory*.

rizzo-pii is deliberately the opposite specialization: *Italian-first* (while
still multilingual), *legal-domain* aware, with a richer 22-tag taxonomy, and a
*smaller memory footprint*: one dense ~0.3B-parameter model (~1.2 GB in fp32,
~0.5 GB quantized) instead of 1.5B parameters to load. It also pairs the neural
model with a deterministic *regex + checksum* safety net (mod-97 for IBAN, Luhn
for cards, the official CF/PIVA algorithms) that the larger generic model does
not provide.

// =============================================================================
= The taxonomy: 22 tags, and why
// =============================================================================

rizzo-pii predicts 22 entity types in BIO format (a `B-`/`I-` label per tag,
plus `O`). The taxonomy is the product of a deliberate design
choice: tag *what a span is* (the thing to mask), not the role it happens to
play in a given document. The raw datasets are left untouched; the mapping to
these 22 tags is applied at load time through a single `TAG_MAP`, so the
taxonomy can be changed in one place without re-annotating anything.

)

*Two design decisions stand out.* First, *legal roles collapse into
`FULLNAME`.* Whether "Mario Rossi" is the judge, the lawyer or a witness is not
a property of the string: the same name can be a judge in one act and a lawyer
in another. Forcing the model to output the role would teach it keyword-matching
("the name after _avvocato_") rather than understanding; the role, if needed, is
recovered downstream as metadata. Second, *we merge raw types that mean the same
thing*: given names + surnames → `FULLNAME`; `PEC` → `EMAIL`; `TAXNUM` → `PIVA`;
ID card / passport / licence / social number → `ID_DOC`; account number →
`IBAN`. Two raw types are dropped to `O` because they are *not* identifiers to
mask: honorifics (`Dott.`, `Avv.`) and the name of the *court* itself (a public
body, kept as context).

The five Italian-legal tags are the reason rizzo-pii exists: `CF`, `PIVA`,
`CATASTO`, `DOCID` and `PROVINCE` simply do not appear as labeled data in any
public corpus, so they are created through synthesis with mathematically valid
checksums (see §6).

// =============================================================================
= Dataset
// =============================================================================

The model is trained on a *multilingual* pool of ≈*745k* labeled rows assembled
from four sources, all remapped to the 22 tags at load time. The guiding
principle for the synthetic part is what we call *"LLM-author / code-labeler"*.

#callout("Key idea: LLM writes the prose, code injects the data")[
  An LLM (Gemini) writes only Italian legal *prose with placeholders* (`{SLOT}`);
  our code then *injects* the actual values (fiscal codes, VAT numbers and IBANs
  computed with their *real checksum algorithms*) into those slots. Because we
  know exactly where each value was inserted, the BIO labels are exact and free;
  the checksums are valid by construction; and *no real personal data is ever
  produced by the LLM.* Three hard problems (label noise, invalid identifiers,
  PII leakage) solved at once.

)

In total, *240,000 rows (32.2%) are generated by us*; counting DeepMount's Faker
material, *37.7%* of the pool is synthetic and the remaining *62.3%* is the
real, multilingual Ai4Privacy reference set. The synthetic data is what makes
the Italian-legal tags learnable at all; the real and augmented data is what
keeps them grounded in natural prose and mitigates structural over-fitting.

== Size of the corpus

#grid(columns: (1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr), column-gutter: 8pt, row-gutter: 8pt,
  kpi("744,912", "training rows"),
  kpi("~67.8 M", "words"),
  kpi("~105.9 M", "mmBERT subword tokens"),
  kpi("~5.70 M", "tagged entities"),
)
#v(2pt)
The corpus is ~334 M characters; the average row is 142 subword tokens, the
token/word expansion is 1.56×, and the longest single sequence is *962 tokens*
(a multilingual Ai4Privacy example). This is what motivates the `MAX_LEN = 768`
setting: it admits essentially all of the long synthetic acts (only ~1% of the
synthetic set is truncated) while staying far inside mmBERT's native 8192-token
window. A held-out *validation set of 7,000 real Italian rows* is used for all
metrics (see §8).

== Language distribution

Because every synthetic and DeepMount row is Italian, Italian becomes the most
represented language of the pool (~45%), even though training stays genuinely
multilingual across 8 languages.

The 5.70 M tagged entities are dominated by names and locations; the rare end
(`CREDITCARDNUMBER`, `TARGA`) is ~97× smaller than `FULLNAME`, which is worth
remembering when reading per-tag metrics.

// =============================================================================
= Model and training setup
// =============================================================================

The backbone is *mmBERT-base* (`jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base`), a multilingual encoder
that follows the *ModernBERT* architecture: 22 transformer layers, hidden size
768, 12 attention heads, alternating local/global attention, rotary embeddings,
and a *native 8192-token context*. We chose mmBERT over vanilla ModernBERT
because the latter is almost exclusively English, whereas our use case is
Italian-and-multilingual. The 256k-token multilingual vocabulary is the main
reason the model lands at ≈0.3B parameters. A token-classification head over 44 BIO classes is fine-tuned on top.

*Hardware and time.* Training was done on a single consumer GPU, an *NVIDIA
RTX 5060 Ti, 16 GB* (Blackwell, sm_120), on Windows, with PyTorch built for
CUDA 12.8 (the Blackwell architecture requires a `cu128` build; cpu/cu121 wheels
do not support sm_120). One full epoch over the pool took *under two hours*. VRAM is
the binding constraint on a 16 GB card shared with the desktop: at `MAX_LEN=768`
a dense batch can saturate memory and send the CUDA allocator into thrashing, so
the recipe uses a modest per-step batch with gradient accumulation
(effective 28), `expandable_segments` allocation, and length-grouped batching
with *precomputed* lengths to avoid re-tokenizing the lazy dataset. Evaluation
of the 7,000-row validation set takes ~24 s.

// =============================================================================
= Results
// =============================================================================

== Training dynamics

Training was a single epoch (~26.6k optimizer steps over 744,912 rows). The loss
fell fast and cleanly, kept improving to the very end, and showed no sign of
over-fitting.

#figure(
  grid(columns: (1fr, 1fr), column-gutter: 8pt, align: bottom,
    image("images/v12_training_loss.png"),
    image("images/v12_training_loss_zoom.png"),
  ),
  caption: [Training loss over the full epoch (~26.6k steps). *Left:* every step,
  raw; *right:* a smoothed zoom. It drops from ≈6.2 to below 0.1 within the first
  few hundred steps, then settles into a clean, monotone, low and stable regime
  with no divergence or oscillation.],

  caption: [Validation loss, evaluated four times across the epoch: it decreases
  monotonically (≈0.0137 down to 0.0058) and is *still falling when training stops*.],
)

The numbers confirm the picture: a final training loss of ≈*0.003* and a
validation loss of ≈*0.006* are both very low and very close, so the model is
*not over-fitting*. The tiny train/val gap is exactly what a healthy fit looks
like, and the validation curve is monotone, never turning back up. Crucially, the
validation loss was *still decreasing* when the single planned epoch ended, not
because the model had converged: *more steps, or a second epoch, would very
likely have pushed it lower still*, a cheap and obvious lever for the next run.

== Per-tag accuracy on real Italian validation

On the 7,000-row held-out Italian benchmark the model reaches *0.989 micro-F1*,
with *0.987 precision* and *0.990 recall*, and a token accuracy of *0.998*.
The unweighted per-tag mean (macro-F1) across all 22 tags is *0.987*, and every
one of the five Italian-legal identifiers scores a perfect 1.000.

All five Italian-legal identifiers (`CF`, `PIVA`, `CATASTO`, `DOCID`, `PROVINCE`)
score a perfect *1.000*, as do `ID_DOC`, `DATE`, `TELEPHONENUM`, `GENDER` and
`TARGA`: the categories that no other open model even covers are the ones
rizzo-pii nails. The remaining soft spots are the open, high-variability classes
(`ZIPCODE`, `CREDITCARDNUMBER`, `STREET`, `CITY`) and `ORG`, which is exactly
where a larger, better-balanced dataset would help (see §10–§11).

// =============================================================================
= Deployment: it runs on a normal computer
// =============================================================================

The released checkpoint is ~1.2 GB on disk in fp32 and runs comfortably on a
*CPU*: quantized, its memory footprint is on the order of *0.5 GB*, with *no
GPU required*. That is the whole point: the privacy layer is cheap enough to run
on the same laptop the user already owns. Packaging is provided as a desktop
application: a native window (*Rizzo PII*, Tauri/WebView2) that launches the
Python/Flask backend as a bundled CPU "sidecar", plus a per-user Windows
installer; a CPU-only PyTorch build keeps it fully *offline*.

In production the neural model is never used alone. It is paired with a
deterministic *regex + checksum* network for the structured identifiers
(EMAIL, phone, IBAN, CF, PIVA, credit card, amount, plate), where IBAN/PIVA/card
must pass their *checksum* (mod-97 / Luhn) to be accepted, and a valid checksum
*overrides* the model. This eliminates the classic failure mode of a
neural tagger fragmenting a long code, and gives mathematically certain
detection for exactly the identifiers whose leakage is most damaging. The app
itself adds the reversible layer (stable placeholders, downloadable local
dictionary, a "restore" tab tolerant to markdown/format drift), chunking with
overlap for long PDFs, and a colored per-tag UI.

// =============================================================================
= Limitations
// =============================================================================

We state the boundaries plainly:

- *Validation is Italian-only.* Training is multilingual, but the 7,000-row
  benchmark measures Italian only, by design, since the target domain is
  Italian legal text. The other seven languages are trained but not certified.
- *The IT-legal tags are validated against injected entities.* `CF`, `PIVA`,
  `CATASTO`, `DOCID`, `PROVINCE` have no real public data, so even in validation they are
  generated entities placed into real sentences: a good proxy, not a fully
  blind test.
- *Class imbalance and under-represented categories.* The corpus is heavily
  skewed (`FULLNAME` outnumbers `CREDITCARDNUMBER` ~97×), so the rarer tags are
  noisier and should lean on the checksum net in production. The clearest case is
  *organizations* (`ORG`): company, firm and bank names are an open, highly
  variable class, yet today they come largely from synthetic templates and
  off-domain Faker data, with little real Italian coverage, so this is where the
  model is most likely to slip, and where a larger, *balanced* and
  *representative* dataset would help most (see §11).
- *Off-domain synthetic values.* DeepMount supplies US-style names/addresses,
  useful for form and context, not as Italian values.
- *Evaluation is sentence-level, not document-level.* The 7,000-row benchmark is
  built from short sentences, whereas the real use case is *whole* documents:
  multi-page acts, contracts and rulings. Measuring true end-to-end behaviour
  (long context, PDF chunking with overlap, real act structure) needs a dedicated
  test set of *large, real Italian documents*, which still has to be assembled.

The mitigation that matters in practice: *always pair the model with the
regex/checksum safety net.* The two together are stronger than either alone.

  [
    rizzo-pii proves the thesis: you *can* keep using frontier models and still
    keep your data private, on ordinary hardware, with Italian-legal coverage no
    other open model offers. The clearest path to making it better is *data*. The
    single biggest lever on quality is a large, varied, *real* (and lawfully
    collected) Italian corpus: both for the legal identifiers that are scarce
    today (the part we have had to synthesize) and, above all, to *balance the
    classes* and add genuine coverage where the model is weakest: *organizations*
    (company, firm and bank names), which are far too varied to learn from
    templates alone. We also need a *test set of large, real documents* (whole
    acts, contracts and rulings, lawfully shared), so the model can be measured
    end-to-end on the documents it is actually meant to anonymize, not only on
    isolated sentences.

    So the project is *open source*, and this is an open invitation. If you work
    with Italian documents (lawyers, accountants, notaries, developers,
    researchers), help build a *shared Italian PII dataset*: contribute
    templates, annotation, edge cases, and review. A privacy tool for Italy is
    something Italy should build together, for the good of everyone's privacy.
